This is a custom discord I made both as a test on how Discord bots work and also just as a fun one night coding adventure. 
Make sure to install the libraries in the requirements.txt file and to use your own discord developer bot token (hopefully youve kept it in a .env file)
if you ever, for some reason, want to use this bot.  


*So, what can he do?*  
  
***He'll respond randomly every time a message is said, though the chances of that are 1 in 5***  
***He'll react to a specific user every time a message is said, though the chances of that are also 1 in 5***  
  
***He responds to new users via 1 of many messages***  
  
***He can also respond to these specific commands***

He is built on discord's python library and uses both dotenv and flask for some minor details
